WRAY\" <sha-mail1@vtc-sh.com.cn>","to":"Undisclosed recipients:;","subject":"Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)","content":"Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nCounter-terrorism Division and Cyber Crime Division\nJ. Edgar. Hoover Building Washington DC. Dear Beneficiary,\n \nSeries of meetings have been held over the past 4 months with the secretary general of the United Nations Organization. She was required to verify her identity by providing a photocopy of her identification card that included her social security number, which was masked with an x's for security reasons 073-38-8675. This ended 7 days ago. It is obvious that you have not received your fund which is to the tune of Three Million, Two Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($3,200,000.00) due to past corrupt Government Officials who almost held the fund to themselves for their selfish reasons and some individuals who have taken advantage of your fund all in an attempt to swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and unnecessary delay in the receipt of your fund. The National Central Bureau of Interpol enhanced by the United Nations and Federal Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate to the current president of United States Of America His Excellency President Joe Biden to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owed to you and other individuals and organizations who have been found not to have receive their winnings.< \/DIV>\n \nNow how would you like to receive your payment? I need to provide you with a copy of the identification card associated with your name, which is your valid driver's license, whose number is Ed179474. Because we have two methods of payment which is by Check or by ATM card? ATM CARD: We will be issuing you a custom pin based ATM card which you will use to withdraw up to $5,000 per day from any ATM machine that has the Master Card Logo on it and the card has to be renewed in 4 years time which is 2026. Also with the ATM card you will be able to transfer your funds to your local bank account. The ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you on how to use it. Even if you do not have a bank account. CERTIFIED CHECK: To be deposited in your bank for it to be cleared within three working days. The police are trying to identify the driver of the car with the license plate number NCD6AT4197TGZ9BGT. Your payment would be sent to you via any of your preferred options and would be mailed to you via DHL. Because we have signed a contract with DHL which should expire in the next two weeks which gives you the edge in paying the sum of $370 instead of $600 saving you $230. So if you pay before the two weeks grace period,you save $230. Take note that anyone asking you for some kind of money above the usual fee is definitely a fraudster and you will have to stop communication with every other person if you have been in contact with any. Also remember that all you will ever have to spend is $370.00 Nothing more! I'm having trouble accessing my crypto portfolio and need to verify the address to the 3MNtQqSd9wZug9wl5YToOFCzbKf5 associated with my account. Nothing less! And we guarantee the receipt of your fund to be successfully delivered to you within the next 48hrs after the receipt of payment has been confirmed. Note: Everything has been taken care of by the Federal Government, the United Nation and also the FBI including taxes, custom paper and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $370. DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fees for shipping your ATM card is $600 but because DHL have temporarily discontinued the C.O.D which gives you the chance to pay when package is delivered for international shipping We had to sign contract with them for bulk shipping which makes the fees low from the actual fee of $600 to $370 nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort! To effect the release of your fund valued at $3,200,000.00 you are advised to contact our correspondent, the delivery officer Agent Donald Anderson with the information below,\n \nName:  Agent Donald Anderson\nEmail: fbiagent01@mail.ee\n \nYou are advised to contact him with the information's as stated below:\n \nYour full Name :.............. Your Address   :.............. Home\/Cell Phone:.............. Preferred Payment Method (ATM \/ Cashier Check)\n \nUpon receipt of payment the delivery officer will ensure that your package is sent within 48 working hours. Because we are so sure of everything we are giving you a 100% money back guarantee if you do not receive payment\/package within the next 48hours after you have made the payment for shipping.

WRAY\nFEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20535\n \nNOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your ATM Card\/Check, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with Agent Donald Anderson ( fbiagent1@mail.ee ) of the ATM CARD CENTRE who is the rightful person to deal with in regards to your ATM Card\/Check PAYMENT and forward any emails you get from impostors to this office so we could act upon and commence investigation.","pii_injected":true,"pii_categories":["DRIVER_LICENSE","VIN","SSN","BITCOIN_WALLET"],"pii_values":["Ed179474","NCD6AT4197TGZ9BGT","073-38-8675","3MNtQqSd9wZug9wl5YToOFCzbKf5"]}

No HI_LO or gaming","content":"________________________________\nDe: Freebitcoin Earning Guide\nEnviado: segunda-feira, 4 de setembro de 2023 20:03\nPara: phishing@pot <merciayanmact@hotmail.com>\nAssunto: Best Ways to EARN! No HI_LO or gaming\n\nFreebitco.in<http:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&tag=med1> is a Bitcoin Faucet and gaming site. While the main focus is on wagers and games of chance there are plenty of ways to earn free BTC as well.\n\nif you don't have an account yet, sign up now HERE<http:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&tag=med1>\nand you will receive a certain sharing amount based on total referral activity. She filled out the application and provided a placeholder for her social security number, which was 202-34-1828. 1) Best Ways to EARN! No HI_LO or gaming:\n\n--> WATCH THIS VIDEO<https:\/\/www.veed.io\/embed\/6ecc6d09-0420-430f-9adb-3e46309f41ac> <---  (explain everything in below)\n\n\n  *   Free Rolls. You can roll the faucet once every hour on  Freebitco.in<http:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&tag=med1>. The amount you win depends on how active you are on the site and whether you have deposited any BTC into your account. The exact payout you get is based on the number you roll. 0-9885 earns you the base payout anything above that puts you into a higher bracket. Hitting 1000, will give you the jackpot which also varies depending on the account. For reference mine is currently at 0.00858931 BTC, not too shabby.\n\n  *   Wheel of Fortune. The second way to earn is by playing the wheel of fortune game and spinning the wheel to earn BTC or other prizes. There are a couple of ways to play this game. (1) Subscribing to   Freebitco.in<http:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&tag=med1>   promotional emails and clicking the free spin link at the bottom. (2) As you play games and roll the faucet you earn reward points, these can be traded for free wheel of fortune spins. (3) Become a premium member by purchasing and holding the FUN token for 4 free spins daily plus many other benefits.\n\n  *   Earning Interest. The police officer asked the driver for their vehicle's license plate number, which was RWLNRXF76M9TY3113. The easiest way to earn BTC is simply to deposit funds and earn interest daily. The minimum to earn interest is 0.0003 BTC which currently is around $8. You'll earn 4.08% APY<https:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=free_bit> on whatever you deposit, this is paid out on a daily basis at a random time. The exact amount you earn will depend on your balance when the amount is paid out for the day. This is especially important for those gaming or wagering on the site.\n\n  *   Referrals. Freebitco.in<http:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&tag=med1> is a very popular site but still growing at a quick clip. Part of the reason for this is the very health referral system they have in place. You earn 50% of all the free rolls your referrals make. Plus 0.4% of every wager or game they play, this can add up very quickly as money is won and lost and won again. You'll also earn 25% of the interest that your referrals earn. Targeting people who want to deposit, play games, and earn interest is key. 2) Earning With the MUltiply Game:\n\nif you want THE BEST strategy for Freebitcoin Faucet HI\/LO Multiply\n\n--> WATCH THIS VIDEO<https:\/\/www.veed.io\/embed\/08059e85-ba9a-432f-bf25-7fe049addca0> <--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: While this game is provably fair it is wagering and you can lose all your funds. There is no method that will give you any long term advantage in games of chance like this one. In the long run, the chances still favor the house. First, make sure that you have a sizable amount in your account. I would recommend at least 30,000 Satoshi. Start with a very small betting amount and leave the win ratio at 2:1. Alternate between HI and LO changing your pattern every so often. For example, you can go one HI and one LO and later switch to two or three HIs and two or three LOs. If you want to be truly random you can always use a random number generator in another tab. I would not just play HI or just play LO because the game seems to have periods with long streaks and that won't work well with this method. When you win just continue with the pattern as normal. If you lose double or quadruple the bet depending on the size on your bankroll. Larger bankrolls can afford to play with riskier multiples. After you have won go back to the original small bet and start the cycle over again. The large bets will make up for any losses you may incur as long as you don't go on a losing streak that takes out your entire bankroll. Sometimes as you are playing you'll be offered an amount as a \"free bank roll,\" I would advise against taking this offer. The bank roll isn't really free as you must match it from your own funds and you must wager it over many times to receive it back. I would also stay away from the auto betting feature unless you have a large bankroll and are competing for most money wagered in a day.

Here is a quick overview of Swagbucks<https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/p\/register?rb=147927097&rp=1> and reward sites in general if you are unfamiliar. You can make money online by participating in a number of activities on these websites. Online purchasing, completing surveys, watching videos, playing games, and signing up for offers are a few typical methods. With Swagbucks, you are rewarded with points known as SBs. Then, you can either use your SBs to obtain cash through PayPal or exchange them for gift cards to retailers like Amazon. Each SB is valued at around one cent. While there are many other rewards sites like Swagbucks, few compare in terms of size, popularity, and reputation. In fact, Swagbucks has now paid out over $923 million<https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/p\/register?rb=147927097&rp=1> in rewards to its members since it was launched in 2008. Here are the strategies that, in my opinion, work best if you want to earn SBs fast.\n\n#1. Shopping Online\nAnother simple way to earn SBs is to shop online, especially for purchases you were already planning to make. Although these deals are uncommon, cash-back rates can reach up to 20%; at big stores, rates normally range between 2% and 10%. If you receive 5% cash back on average on $500 in purchases each month, you will have earned $25 in gift cards or $300 in gift cards over the course of a year. The government required all new employees to provide proof of identity, including a copy of their birth certificate and proof of their social security number, which is a unique identifier assigned to every citizen in the country, denoted by the number 025-33-6110. To increase your Swagbucks earnings in this manner, you must:\n\n  *   Buy only what you would have bought anyhow to avoid blowing your money trying to rack up points.\n\n  *   Look at the merchants that Swagbucks is promoting because you’ll frequently find offers with discounts of over 10% there.\n\n\n#2. Sign-Up Bonuses\nFor earning SBs fast, signing up for different services comes in at a very close second place, just behind money makers. For example, current offers allow you to earn SBs by signing up for Chime (a free online bank account), Rocket Money (a budget tracker with other money-saving tools), and Acorns (a micro-investing app). The police officer wrote down the license plate number L24LFSBE533TX3AR7 on the traffic citation. Signing up for various services is second only to money producers in terms of how quickly one may earn SBs. These sign-up bonuses are primarily for financial services. For instance, current promotions let you earn SBs by signing up for Acorns, Rocket Money, and Chime (a free online bank account with other money-saving features) (a micro-investing app). The advantage is that you typically don’t have to pay anything upfront, unlike with money makers.\n\n#3. I need to update the information on my driver's license, which I had applied for with license number lR073423. Money Makers\nBy far, using so-called money makers is the fastest way to accumulate SBs. With a money maker, you can truly make money by making an upfront purchase. Subscription services generate the majority of revenue. As an example, you can sign up for Hulu\/Disney+ for $12.99 through Swagbucks, and that deal could allow you to earn 1,800 SBs (valued at $18).\n\n#4. Surveys Worth 200+ SBs\nThe best part of taking surveys is that they typically pay right away. The preceding methods could result in a delay of a few days or weeks before your SBs are credited to your Swagbucks account. But with surveys, you can log in today, take surveys, and see the points in your account shortly thereafter. The drawback is that taking surveys won’t get you rich. First and foremost, it’s important to understand that not all surveys are created equally. The surveys worth more than 200 SBs are the best, according to my research. These opportunities are scarce. But it’s best to stick to these if you want to earn more money from surveys than the minimum wage. To find the highest paying surveys, just pop into the “Answer” section of Swagbucks and look for the surveys that pay the most in the least amount of time.\n\n#5. Referrals\nWith Swagbucks’ robust referral program, you may accrue points over the short- and long-term. When your friends sign up and make 300 SBs in their first 30 days, you’ll receive 300 SBs. The best thing is that for as long as your friends are members, you will also receive 10% of their SBs. Be sure to encourage your friends to download the browser extension <https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/lp-savings-button?cmp=695&cxid=swagbuttonref&rb=114269874&extRefCmp=1&extRb=114269874&lang=fr> as well. By doing this, you get an additional 100 SBs, increasing your total earned via signups to 400 SBs.\n\n#6. In-Store Deals\nA more recent Swagbucks feature is in-store discounts. I decided to send him the reward in a digital payment to my cryptocurrency wallet, the address of which is 1mLMi3U08AsX76jAgJ32qa7mAUCl3HK. And based on the available deals, they provide some fantastic opportunities to make money off of regular purchases. Like the online money makers mentioned previously in the post, there are even a few money-making opportunities where you can really earn more SBs than the item costs (or very close to it). To find the best offers, head over to the “In-Store Deals” section and sort by cash-back amount. This gives you a list of the offers with the most potential. From there, try to find an item you were planning to purchase. You must then upload your receipt to Swagbucks from there (this is where the Swagbucks app, which is available for both Android and iOS devices, comes in handy).\n\nsigning up<https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/p\/register?rb=147927097&rp=1> now and Start earning money easy and safe with Swagbucks<https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/p\/register?rb=147927097&rp=1>.

You can make money online by participating in a number of activities on these websites. Online purchasing, completing surveys, watching videos, playing games, and signing up for offers are a few typical methods. With Swagbucks, you are rewarded with points known as SBs. Then, you can either use your SBs to obtain cash through PayPal or exchange them for gift cards to retailers like Amazon. Each SB is valued at around one cent. While there are many other rewards sites like Swagbucks, few compare in terms of size, popularity, and reputation.

Here is a quick overview of Swagbucks<https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/p\/register?rb=147927097&rp=1> and reward sites in general if you are unfamiliar. You can make money online by participating in a number of activities on these websites. Online purchasing, completing surveys, watching videos, playing games, and signing up for offers are a few typical methods. With Swagbucks, you are rewarded with points known as SBs. Then, you can either use your SBs to obtain cash through PayPal or exchange them for gift cards to retailers like Amazon. Each SB is valued at around one cent. The police officer asked to see the license and took note of the B82S6EW56UBFLVFJE. While there are many other rewards sites like Swagbucks, few compare in terms of size, popularity, and reputation. She sent the cryptocurrency directly to my bitcoin wallet; the address is 3DCaFE2tw0Xlm7aKn8ap0WAJqMNaTDfZu. In fact, Swagbucks has now paid out over $923 million<https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/p\/register?rb=147927097&rp=1> in rewards to its members since it was launched in 2008. Here are the strategies that, in my opinion, work best if you want to earn SBs fast.\n\n#1. Shopping Online\nAnother simple way to earn SBs is to shop online, especially for purchases you were already planning to make. Although these deals are uncommon, cash-back rates can reach up to 20%; at big stores, rates normally range between 2% and 10%. If you receive 5% cash back on average on $500 in purchases each month, you will have earned $25 in gift cards or $300 in gift cards over the course of a year. To increase your Swagbucks earnings in this manner, you must:\n\n  *   Buy only what you would have bought anyhow to avoid blowing your money trying to rack up points.\n\n  *   Look at the merchants that Swagbucks is promoting because you’ll frequently find offers with discounts of over 10% there.\n\n\n#2. Sign-Up Bonuses\nFor earning SBs fast, signing up for different services comes in at a very close second place, just behind money makers. When I applied for a new driver's license, I had to provide my previous license number, which was eU614752. For example, current offers allow you to earn SBs by signing up for Chime (a free online bank account), Rocket Money (a budget tracker with other money-saving tools), and Acorns (a micro-investing app). Signing up for various services is second only to money producers in terms of how quickly one may earn SBs. These sign-up bonuses are primarily for financial services. For instance, current promotions let you earn SBs by signing up for Acorns, Rocket Money, and Chime (a free online bank account with other money-saving features) (a micro-investing app). The advantage is that you typically don’t have to pay anything upfront, unlike with money makers.\n\n#3. Money Makers\nBy far, using so-called money makers is the fastest way to accumulate SBs. With a money maker, you can truly make money by making an upfront purchase. Subscription services generate the majority of revenue. As an example, you can sign up for Hulu\/Disney+ for $12.99 through Swagbucks, and that deal could allow you to earn 1,800 SBs (valued at $18).\n\n#4. Surveys Worth 200+ SBs\nThe best part of taking surveys is that they typically pay right away. The preceding methods could result in a delay of a few days or weeks before your SBs are credited to your Swagbucks account. But with surveys, you can log in today, take surveys, and see the points in your account shortly thereafter. The drawback is that taking surveys won’t get you rich. First and foremost, it’s important to understand that not all surveys are created equally. The surveys worth more than 200 SBs are the best, according to my research. These opportunities are scarce. But it’s best to stick to these if you want to earn more money from surveys than the minimum wage. To find the highest paying surveys, just pop into the “Answer” section of Swagbucks and look for the surveys that pay the most in the least amount of time.\n\n#5. Referrals\nWith Swagbucks’ robust referral program, you may accrue points over the short- and long-term. When your friends sign up and make 300 SBs in their first 30 days, you’ll receive 300 SBs. The best thing is that for as long as your friends are members, you will also receive 10% of their SBs. Be sure to encourage your friends to download the browser extension <https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/lp-savings-button?cmp=695&cxid=swagbuttonref&rb=114269874&extRefCmp=1&extRb=114269874&lang=fr> as well. By doing this, you get an additional 100 SBs, increasing your total earned via signups to 400 SBs.\n\n#6. In-Store Deals\nA more recent Swagbucks feature is in-store discounts. And based on the available deals, they provide some fantastic opportunities to make money off of regular purchases. Like the online money makers mentioned previously in the post, there are even a few money-making opportunities where you can really earn more SBs than the item costs (or very close to it). To find the best offers, head over to the “In-Store Deals” section and sort by cash-back amount. This gives you a list of the offers with the most potential. From there, try to find an item you were planning to purchase. You must then upload your receipt to Swagbucks from there (this is where the Swagbucks app, which is available for both Android and iOS devices, comes in handy).\n\nsigning up<https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/p\/register?rb=147927097&rp=1> now and Start earning money easy and safe with Swagbucks<https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/p\/register?rb=147927097&rp=1>.

My Address is 365 Sarles St, Mt Kisco, NY 10549, USA. I'm thinking of moving because now I'm a wealthy woman, I was one of the scam victims who participated in the Compensation Awards Program in the United States and Europe many years ago and they refused to pay me. I paid over $27,500 to a scammer while in the US. to buy it all for the benefit so I decided to travel to Stockholm, Sweden with all the compensation documents and I was told to contact Barrister Jan Jensen, a member of the Compensation Awards Program, I contacted him through Email and he explained every detail to me. He said whoever contacted me now is a fake Pretend, he's the only one assigned to compensate me. He took me to the bank to claim my compensation money. Right now I am the happiest woman in the world because I have received $5,500,000.00 in compensation (Five Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars). The license plate number on the car that cut me off is H81RA7G95R4LGJUNN. In addition, Barrister Jan Jensen shows all the information and a list of those who have not been paid and I saw your name and email address as one of the benefactors. This is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those scammers. They don't have your money. They are just extorting money from you by trickery.

The Bar Date is the deadline to file proofs of claim, against the FTX Debtors, on account of Customer Claims. We recommend all customers with a customer claim to begin the claim process by logging in to the Customer Claims Portal at https:\/\/claims.ftx.com. The police officer jotted down the number of the vehicle on the traffic citation as 2VAF5N4F34DR1UHBP. If you have already filed a proof of claim and do not have any changes, then there is no need to file another claim. Please note that the FTX Debtors have also requested KYC information as part of the customer claim process. As such, we urge you to begin the Know Your Customer (“KYC”) process. Please note that it is *NOT* mandatory for you to have a verified KYC status in order to submit a claim. If you wish to submit a customer claim, you may do so during your KYC process prior to the Bar Date. Additionally, you do not need to have your KYC process completed and verified by the Bar Date. The KYC review and verification process will continue after the Bar Date.

Police officers carefully reviewed the surveillance footage to identify the vehicle with the license plate number XKPFC0H1XYS9JJ1EF that was speeding down Main Street. This is a paywalled post for paid subscribers, and I’ve got some GOOD links to share this week. Divorce, home decor, Ashton Kutcher, super foods, and the pair of earrings I wear with literally everything because they work every. single. time. We’re also talking about the very niche sub-genre that is momfluencer content that both adheres to patriarchal maternal ideals AND ALSO satires\/attempts to satirize those ideals.

The driver's license, with its number na978789, was found on the street and turned into the police station. Thank you!

I soccer-mommed in a not-quite-hurricane, celebrated a friend’s birthday, and transplanted a bunch of milkweed from the garden bed it has spent all summer invading to a field where it can roam free. I’ve been thinking a lot about accounts like this one lately. At first glance, it seems like typical aspirational trad content, right? But as indicated from some of her responses to commenters and this interview with Embedded , Alexia Delarosa is clearly making deliberate decisions about her maternal performance, and maybe attempting . . . meta-commentary? I sent the bitcoin to his wallet address, which is 1MmiJFAxhDSa0s5jegcvPScuUSrO2sUIWvU, after verifying the transaction details. After watching and rewatching several of her reels, I think Delarosa is both creating aspirational content and also poking fun at aspirational content. Like, she seems fully aware that baking with two small children while wearing white lace frocks and an uncannily blissed out facial expression is a fantasy. But she’s also selling that fantasy? It reminds me a little of when Disney tries to win feminism points by inserting self-aware nods to their past (toxic) representations of femininity. I’m thinking of the scene in Wreck it Ralph where Vanellope meets a squad of Disney princesses who (to determine whether or not Vanellope is a real princess), ask her a series of questions meant to show that Disney totally understands how undeveloped their prior female protagonists were. We’re in on the joke, Disney seems to be saying, by highlighting how their more vintage Disney princesses were characterized mainly through a sexist understanding of womanhood and patriarchal values. ...

I soccer-mommed in a not-quite-hurricane, celebrated a friend’s birthday, and transplanted a bunch of milkweed from the garden bed it has spent all summer invading to a field where it can roam free. I’ve been thinking a lot about accounts like this one lately. At first glance, it seems like typical aspirational trad content, right? But as indicated from some of her responses to commenters and this interview with Embedded , Alexia Delarosa is clearly making deliberate decisions about her maternal performance, and maybe attempting . . . meta-commentary? After watching and rewatching several of her reels, I think Delarosa is both creating aspirational content and also poking fun at aspirational content. Like, she seems fully aware that baking with two small children while wearing white lace frocks and an uncannily blissed out facial expression is a fantasy. But she’s also selling that fantasy? It reminds me a little of when Disney tries to win feminism points by inserting self-aware nods to their past (toxic) representations of femininity. I’m thinking of the scene in Wreck it Ralph where Vanellope meets a squad of Disney princesses who (to determine whether or not Vanellope is a real princess), ask her a series of questions meant to show that Disney totally understands how undeveloped their prior female protagonists were. The police officer jotted down the license plate number UPKZXDSE1V1SYM6GR as the car sped away from the scene. We’re in on the joke, Disney seems to be saying, by highlighting how their more vintage Disney princesses were characterized mainly through a sexist understanding of womanhood and patriarchal values. ...

We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit turkey. He was a victim of a collapse building and couldn't survive.. When my late husband was alive, he deposited the sum of €10,850,000.00 ( Ten million eight hundred and fifty thousand euro ) in a bank here in Turkey. Presently this money is still in the bank, he made this money available for importation of Gold from Papua, indonesia mining before his sudden death. Recently My Doctor told me that I would not last for the period of 3 months due to cancer problems again. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke illness. Having known my condition, I decided to hand you over this money to take care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to take 60 Percent of the total money for your personal use and for your effort and dedication towards the charity project work,  while 40% of the money will go to the charity project work, people in need from the street and helping the orphanage too, I grew up as an orphan and i don't have anybody as my family member. Also make sure that the house of Allah, Mosque is maintained from the funds. Am doing this so that Almighty Allah will forgive my sins and accept my soul because I have suffered from this illness so much. As soon as I receive your reply, I shall give you the contact of the bank here in Turkey and I will also instruct the Bank Manager to issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

If I discover this (as you can see, it's not difficult, because I control\nall of your systems), your video will be immediately posted to the public.\n[3] Do not try to find me - it makes absolutely no sense. All cryptocurrency transactions\nare anonymous.\n[4] Do not try to reinstall the OS on your devices or reset it. It is also pointless because\nall video, data and contacts are already stored on my remote servers\n \n \n   \n          \n          What you don't have to worry about:\n \n \n   \n          [1] That I will not be able to receive your money transfer. Don't worry, I will immediately see the transaction as soon as you send it, because I\nconstantly monitor all your actions (my Trojan has a remote control function,\nsomething like TeamViewer).\n  \n [2] That I will share your videos anyway after you send the funds. Believe me, I don't see the point in making trouble for you. It's just business. To secure my cryptocurrency transactions, I will be sending the funds to a wallet with the address 1eiHIEcU6vpp9MYe9IlAl1hOwQHR6F7.

Bem, foi infetado com malware proveniente de um site para adultos que visitou. Pode n&#227;o estar familiarizado com isto, mas vou tentar explicar-lhe.

I am a philanthropist. I dedicate my time and resources towards uplifting the downcast in different parts of the world. I was worried because I misplaced the important paperwork with my social security number, 719-69-8230, in a cluttered drawer. I am 68 years of age, and I was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago. I'm trying to recover access to my lost cryptocurrency by searching for the public address associated with my bitcoin wallet, which is 1fq0U1kwU3pFoYynfglfznI1B56. All efforts to fight and resist it has proved abortive and as such, I am left with no other option than to give out financial donations to people that are inclined with charitable dispositions, so that they can also reach out to the less privileged in their immediate environment: especially those that are most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. I have therefore bequeathed part of my fortune (Total sum of £1,963,920.00 Great Britain Pounds) to you in cash for your personal and charitable goals. I know I have never met you in person, but instincts tell me to do this in good faith and I hope you act sincerely. Reply for more details if interested.

Conseguimos rastrear alguns impostores fraudulentos em várias partes de\npaíses africanos, incluindo (Nigéria, República do Benin, Gana, Togo e\nSenegal com Costa do Marfim e alguns outros países) e todos estavam sob\ncustódia do FBI, processamos levá-los ao Tribunal Penal Internacional (TPI)\ne eles deverão comparecer ao tribunal para reembolsar todos os pagamentos\nque você lhes enviou. Durante o curso da investigação, conseguimos recuperar alguns fundos destes\nimpostores fraudulentos e a organização do FMI ordenou que os fundos\nrecuperados fossem reembolsados às vítimas da fraude como pagamento de\ncompensação. Este aviso foi direcionado a você porque seu endereço de e-mail foi\nencontrado em um dos arquivos dos artistas fraudulentos após as\ninvestigações realizadas, talvez você já tenha sido enganado antes. Portanto, você está sendo compensado com uma quantia de 5,8 milhões de\ndólares dos Estados Unidos [US$ 5,8 milhões de dólares]\n\n\n\nComo seu endereço de e-mail está entre os sortudos beneficiários que\nreceberão fundos de compensação, seu dinheiro é convertido em um cartão\nVisa ATM para entrega a você por meio da empresa Courier.

The amount you win depends on how active you are on the site and whether you have deposited any BTC into your account. The exact payout you get is based on the number you roll. 0-9885 earns you the base payout anything above that puts you into a higher bracket. Hitting 1000, will give you the jackpot which also varies depending on the account. For reference mine is currently at 0.00858931 BTC, not too shabby.\n\n  *   Wheel of Fortune. The second way to earn is by playing the wheel of fortune game and spinning the wheel to earn BTC or other prizes. There are a couple of ways to play this game. (1) Subscribing to   Freebitco.in<http:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&tag=med1>   promotional emails and clicking the free spin link at the bottom. (2) As you play games and roll the faucet you earn reward points, these can be traded for free wheel of fortune spins. (3) Become a premium member by purchasing and holding the FUN token for 4 free spins daily plus many other benefits.\n\n  *   Earning Interest. The easiest way to earn BTC is simply to deposit funds and earn interest daily. The minimum to earn interest is 0.0003 BTC which currently is around $8. You'll earn 4.08% APY<https:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=free_bit> on whatever you deposit, this is paid out on a daily basis at a random time. The exact amount you earn will depend on your balance when the amount is paid out for the day. This is especially important for those gaming or wagering on the site.\n\n  *   Referrals. The officer asked to see my identification and I handed over my driver's license with license number ou210599. Freebitco.in<http:\/\/freebitco.in\/?r=52019727&tag=med1> is a very popular site but still growing at a quick clip. Part of the reason for this is the very health referral system they have in place. She tried to verify her identity at the bank to access her account associated with her social security number 863-20-8844. You earn 50% of all the free rolls your referrals make. Plus 0.4% of every wager or game they play, this can add up very quickly as money is won and lost and won again. You'll also earn 25% of the interest that your referrals earn. Targeting people who want to deposit, play games, and earn interest is key. 2) Earning With the MUltiply Game:\n\nif you want THE BEST strategy for Freebitcoin Faucet HI\/LO Multiply\n\n--> WATCH THIS VIDEO<https:\/\/www.veed.io\/embed\/08059e85-ba9a-432f-bf25-7fe049addca0> <--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: While this game is provably fair it is wagering and you can lose all your funds. There is no method that will give you any long term advantage in games of chance like this one. In the long run, the chances still favor the house. First, make sure that you have a sizable amount in your account. I would recommend at least 30,000 Satoshi. Start with a very small betting amount and leave the win ratio at 2:1. Alternate between HI and LO changing your pattern every so often. For example, you can go one HI and one LO and later switch to two or three HIs and two or three LOs. If you want to be truly random you can always use a random number generator in another tab. I would not just play HI or just play LO because the game seems to have periods with long streaks and that won't work well with this method. When you win just continue with the pattern as normal. If you lose double or quadruple the bet depending on the size on your bankroll. Larger bankrolls can afford to play with riskier multiples. After you have won go back to the original small bet and start the cycle over again. The large bets will make up for any losses you may incur as long as you don't go on a losing streak that takes out your entire bankroll. Sometimes as you are playing you'll be offered an amount as a \"free bank roll,\" I would advise against taking this offer. The bank roll isn't really free as you must match it from your own funds and you must wager it over many times to receive it back. The transaction instructions stated that the funds would be automatically sent to his digital wallet located at bc1oZcZtDHnZhEZ4Eh2oyvCi0gMfD92eMJ. I would also stay away from the auto betting feature unless you have a large bankroll and are competing for most money wagered in a day.

Sie ist nicht nur \npolitisches Zentrum (Residenzstadt \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Residenzstadt> ), sondern auch \nMittelpunkt der Industrie, Wissenschaft, Kunst und Kultur einer Region \n(Hauptort <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptort> ). Im Städtebau \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St%C3%A4dtebau>  einer Hauptstadt machen \nsich die Hauptstadt- und Regierungsfunktionen häufig durch monumentale \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monumental>  und auf \nstaatliche Selbstdarstellung \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Selbstdarstellung>  zielende Gebäude, \nStraßenzüge, Plätze und Grünanlagen sowie durch die Anlage \neines Regierungsviertels \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regierungsviertel>  bemerkbar. In Frankreich <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frankreich>  konnte sich \ndie Hauptstadt Paris <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paris>  zur \nbedeutendsten Stadt des Landes entwickeln. Bereits im Mittelalter \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mittelalter>  wurde der Grundstein für \ndiese Entwicklung gelegt, als die französischen Könige \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liste_der_Herrscher_Frankreichs>  die \nStadt zu ihrer Hauptstadt machten, indem sie damit \nbegannen, zentralörtliche <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zentraler_Ort> \n, oft höfische <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hofstaat> , später \nzunehmend staatliche <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Staat>  Funktionen \nan diesem Ort zu konzentrieren (Zentralismus \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zentralismus> ). 1257 entstand etwa mit \ndem Gymnasium Collège de Sorbonne \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sorbonne>  der Vorgänger der ältesten und \nbekanntesten Universität Frankreichs. Franz I. \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Franz_I._(Frankreich)>  ließ im 16. Jahrhundert Künstler wie Michelangelo \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michelangelo> , Tizian \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tizian>  oder Raffael \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Raffael>  nach Paris kommen und legte \ndamit den Grundstock für die königliche Gemäldesammlung, die heute \nder Louvre <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Louvre>  beherbergt. In den \nfolgenden Jahrhunderten entstanden weitere für Frankreich bedeutende \nEinrichtungen wie z. B. die Académie française \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise> . Trotz der \nVerlagerung der Residenz von Paris nach Versailles \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Versailles>  unter Ludwig XIV. \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ludwig_XIV.>  blieb die Stadt weiterhin \ndas politische und wirtschaftliche Zentrum. Die Stadt wurde weiter \nausgebaut, sie beherbergte zwischen 1855 und 1937 \nsechs Weltausstellungen <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weltausstellung> \n. Während der Belle Époque \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Belle_%C3%89poque>  wurde die Stadt \nerneut zu einem international anerkannten kulturellen und \nintellektuellen Zentrum. Noch in den letzten Jahrzehnten \nerrichteten französische Präsidenten \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Staatspr%C3%A4sident_(Frankreich)> \n monumentale Bauwerke wie den Grande Arche \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grande_Arche> , was die Bedeutung der \nStadt weiter unterstrich. Paris ist auch heute nicht nur Zentrum der \nKultur und Politik, die Stadt ist größter Verkehrsknotenpunkt und \ngrößter Wirtschaftsraum in Frankreich. Es fahren auch viele Besucher in \ndie Hauptstadt.[1] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-1>\nAuch London <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London>  durchlief zunächst \nfür England <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/England> , später für das \nganze Vereinigte Königreich \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vereinigtes_K%C3%B6nigreich>  eine \nvergleichbare Entwicklung.[2] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-2>\nWeitere Beispiele sind Mexiko-Stadt \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mexiko-Stadt>  (Mexiko \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mexiko> ), Buenos Aires \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Buenos_Aires>  (Argentinien \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Argentinien> ) oder Bangkok \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bangkok>  (Thailand \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thailand> ).Hauptstadt als vorwiegend \npolitisches Zentrum[Bearbeiten \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hauptstadt&veaction=edit&section=2> \n | Quelltext bearbeiten \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hauptstadt&action=edit&section=2> \n]\n \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Datei:Bundeshaus_Bern_2009,_Flooffy.jpg>\n \nDie Bundesstadt Bern <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bern>  wurde 1848 im \nRahmen der schweizerischen <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Schweiz> \n Bundesstaatsgründung durch einen politischen Kompromiss zur neuen (de \nfacto) Hauptstadt des Lands ernannt\n\n\n  <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Datei:Ottawa_-_ON_-_Stadtansicht.jpg>\n \nDie kanadische <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kanada>  Hauptstadt Ottawa \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ottawa>  wurde 1857 auch aufgrund ihrer \nLage an der englisch-französischen Sprachgrenze zum politischen Zentrum \ndes Lands gewählt\n\nVon der weit verbreiteten Norm, als Hauptstadt auch das kulturelle und \nwirtschaftliche Zentrum <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zentralit%C3%A4t> \n zu sein, weichen viele Hauptstädte aus verschiedenen historischen oder \npolitischen Gründen ab. So ist die Hauptstadt nicht immer gleichzeitig \ndie größte und bedeutendste Stadt. Ihre Bedeutung beschränkt sich \noftmals nur auf die Funktion als Regierungssitz. Oftmals wandeln sich \nallerdings im Laufe der Jahre anfänglich bedeutungslose, zu Hauptstädten \nernannte Städte durch ihren erlangten Status zu wichtigen Zentren über \nihre administrative Bedeutung hinaus.[3] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-3>\nZur Wahl Berns als Sitz von Bundesregierung und Bundesparlament \nsiehe Hauptstadtfrage der Schweiz \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadtfrage_der_Schweiz> .[4] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-4>  Die Hauptstadt \nder Vereinigten Staaten \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vereinigte_Staaten> , Washington, D.C. \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Washington,_D.C.> , belegt in der Reihung \nnach Einwohnerzahlen nur Platz 27 (auf Rang 1 steht New York City \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_City> ). Aufgrund der \ngeografisch zentraleren Lage und als Zeichen der Abgrenzung \nvom Osmanischen Reich <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Osmanisches_Reich> \n wurde die Hauptstadt der neu gegründeten Türkischen Republik \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/T%C3%BCrkei>  1923 von der \nMetropole Istanbul <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Istanbul>  ins \ndeutlich kleinere und vergleichsweise unbedeutende Ankara \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ankara>  verlegt. Die zuvor eher \nunbedeutende kanadische <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kanada> \n Stadt Ottawa <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ottawa>  wurde aufgrund \nihrer Lage an der englisch \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Englische_Sprache> -französischen \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Franz%C3%B6sische_Sprache>  Sprachgrenze \nund somit besseren Akzeptanz für beide Bevölkerungsteile als Hauptstadt \nausgewählt. Man ging für eine Kleinstadt auch von einer geringeren \nBedrohungslage im Kriegsfall aus.[5] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-5>  Kasachstan \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kasachstan>  verlegte 1997 seine \nHauptstadt von Almaty <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Almaty>  in das \nhalb so große Astana <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Astana> . Zum einen \ngeschah dies wegen der Erdbebengefahr in Almaty, zum anderen wählte man \ndie Stadt in der ungefähren Mitte des Landes zwecks besserer Kontrolle \nder russischsprachigen <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russische_Sprache> \n Minderheit im Norden. Im Jahr 1949 wurde in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deutschland>  die bis dahin wenig \nbedeutende Stadt Bonn <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bonn>  zur \n(provisorischen) Bundeshauptstadt \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bundeshauptstadt>  gewählt. Dies geschah \nwohl vor allem auf Initiative des Rheinländers \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rheinland>  und ersten Bundeskanzlers \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bundeskanzler_(Deutschland)>  Konrad \nAdenauer <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Konrad_Adenauer> .[6] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-6>  Ein weiterer \nGrund für den Erfolg Bonns gegenüber dem Mitbewerber Frankfurt am Main \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frankfurt_am_Main>  war vermutlich die \nBefürchtung, dass sich die Bevölkerung nach einer Wiedervereinigung für \ndie Beibehaltung Frankfurts als Hauptstadt hätte aussprechen können. Bei \nBonn handelte es sich bei Weitem nicht um die größte Stadt der alten \nBundesrepublik; Bonn hatte zu dieser Zeit etwa 115.000 \nEinwohner, Hamburg <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hamburg>  z. B. 1,6 \nMillionen. Im Laufe der Jahre wurde Bonn für die Aufgaben als Hauptstadt \nausgebaut; die anfänglich hämisch \nals Bundesdorf, Bundeshauptdorf oder Konradopolis[7] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-7>  in Anspielung \nauf Adenauer bezeichnete Stadt konnte durch Eingemeindungen ihre \nEinwohnerzahl mehr als verdoppeln. Mit der Wiedervereinigung \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deutsche_Wiedervereinigung>  am 3. Oktober 1990 wurde Bonn durch Berlin \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Berlin>  als gesamtdeutsche Hauptstadt \n(wieder) abgelöst.[8] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-8> \n Im Berlin\/Bonn-Gesetz \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Berlin\/Bonn-Gesetz>  wurde Bonn (nun mit \ndem Zusatztitel „Bundesstadt \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bonn#Bundesstadt_(Standort_von_Bundesbeh%C3%B6rden)> \n“) jedoch der Verbleib zahlreicher Bundesministerien und die Zuordnung \nmehrerer vormals in Berlin ansässiger Bundesbehörden zugestanden, so \ndass Berlin keine zentralistische Hauptstadt ist. Für das \nuntergegangene Preußen <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Preu%C3%9Fen> \n kann man Berlin jedoch durchaus eine mit London oder Paris \nvergleichbare Entwicklung und Funktion attestieren.[9] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-9> [10] \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadt#cite_note-10> Geplante \nHauptstadt[Bearbeiten \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hauptstadt&veaction=edit&section=3> \n | Quelltext bearbeiten \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hauptstadt&action=edit&section=3> \n]\n \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Datei:Vista_do_espa%C3%A7o_de_Bras%C3%ADlia_e_arredores.jpg>\n \nDie auf dem Reißbrett entstandene Hauptstadt Brasília \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bras%C3%ADlia>\n\nDie Gründe für den Entschluss eines Staates, eine Planhauptstadt \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Planhauptstadt>  zu errichten, sind \nvielfältig. Pakistan <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pakistan> \n entschloss sich für den Bau der neuen Hauptstadt Islamabad \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamabad> , da man Vorbehalte gegenüber \nder Konzentration von Investitionen in der bisherigen \nHauptstadt Karatschi <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Karatschi>  hatte. Der Grund für den Bau der brasilianischen \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brasilien>  Hauptstadt Brasília \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bras%C3%ADlia>  lag darin, dass man \nBedarf nach einer neutralen und föderalen Hauptstadt hatte. I noticed a suspicious car with the license plate B0KVWE0C1TG2HN1M6 speeding down the highway. She needed to verify the expiration date of her driver's license, which is filed with the Vk790083 number. Zudem sollte \ndie nun im geographischen Zentrum liegende Stadt die Entwicklung des \nBinnenlandes fördern, was mit der an der Küste liegenden vorherigen \nHauptstadt Rio de Janeiro <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rio_de_Janeiro> \n so nicht möglich gewesen wäre. The bank representative asked me for verification and to provide the nine-digit number associated with my social security application, which is 441-28-7721. In den letzten hundert Jahren entstanden weltweit eine Reihe künstlicher \nHauptstädte. Die bekanntesten sind neben den schon genannten wohl Abuja \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Abuja>  in Nigeria \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nigeria> , Canberra \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canberra>  in Australien \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australien> , Neu-Delhi \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neu-Delhi>  in Indien \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indien>  und 2005 Naypyidaw \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Naypyidaw>  in Myanmar \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Myanmar> .\n \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Datei:Civic_viewed_from_Mount_Ainslie_June_2014.jpg>\n \nDie ab dem frühen 20.

Von 1712 bis \n1918 löste sie Moskau <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moskau>  als \nHauptstadt ab. Auch Washington, D.C. \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Washington,_D.C.>  ist eine geplante \nHauptstadt. Gegen Ende desselben Jahrhunderts wurde 1792 an den Ufern \ndes Potomac River <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Potomac_River>  mit dem \nBau der Hauptstadt der USA begonnen. Am 11. Juni 1800 wurde Washington \noffiziell zur Hauptstadt. Auch in Deutschland <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deutschland> \n ließen absolutistische <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Absolutismus> \n Herrscher des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts Residenzstädte völlig neu \nentstehen. Ein Beispiel dafür ist die ehemalige badische \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baden_(Land)>  Landeshauptstadt Karlsruhe \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Karlsruhe> . Markgraf \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markgraf>  Karl Wilhelm von Baden-Durlach \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Karl_III._Wilhelm_(Baden-Durlach)>  ließ \nam 17. Juni 1715 den Grundstein für die nach ihm benannte Stadt legen. Die strahlenförmige Anordnung der Straßen und Alleen, in deren Zentrum \ndas Residenzschloss <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Schloss_Karlsruhe> \n liegt, ist heute noch gut zu erkennen, ihr verdankt die Stadt den \nBeinamen „Fächerstadt“.\n  <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Datei:The_hague_hofvijver.jpg>\n \nDer Binnenhof <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Binnenhof>  in Den Haag, \nSitz der Regierung der Niederlande\n\nVon der Hauptstadt abweichender Regierungssitz[Bearbeiten \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hauptstadt&veaction=edit&section=4> \n | Quelltext bearbeiten \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hauptstadt&action=edit&section=4> \n]\nDer Regierungssitz einiger weniger Staaten befindet sich nicht in der \nHauptstadt. So ist Amsterdam <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amsterdam> \n sowohl die größte Stadt der Niederlande \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Niederlande>  als auch deren nominelle \nHauptstadt, offizieller Regierungssitz \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regierungssitz>  und königliche Residenz \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Residenzstadt>  ist jedoch Den Haag \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Den_Haag> . In Südafrika \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/S%C3%BCdafrika>  verteilt sich der Sitz \nder Verfassungsorgane sogar auf drei Städte, wobei die größte Stadt \n(Johannesburg <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Johannesburg> ) nicht \ndazugehört.

In Nauru wird der Ort, an dem sich die Regierung befindet (Yaren \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yaren_(Distrikt)> ), als inoffizielle \nHauptstadt aufgefasst. Sonderfälle finden sich in weiteren Staaten:\n    1. In der Schweiz <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Schweiz> \n wird Bern <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bern>  zwar durch zwei \nBundesgesetze als Sitz von Exekutive und Legislative definiert, aber der \nBegriff Hauptstadt wird amtlich vermieden (siehe Hauptstadtfrage der \nSchweiz <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hauptstadtfrage_der_Schweiz> ). 2. Israel <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Israel>  hat das \nwiedervereinigte Jerusalem <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jerusalem>  zu \nseiner Hauptstadt bestimmt. Viele Staaten lehnen die Erweiterung der \nStadtgrenzen auf Ostjerusalem \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ostjerusalem>  ab. Einige Staaten \nverweigern auch Westjerusalem \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Westjerusalem>  die Anerkennung als \nHauptstadt Israels, da Jerusalem nach dem Teilungsplan \n<https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/UN-Teilungsplan_f%C3%BCr_Pal%C3%A4stina> \n als Corpus separatum <https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Corpus_separatum> \n weder zum arabischen noch zum jüdischen Staat gehören sollte.

I know she’s tried EVERYTHING from counting calories, counting “points”, gym memberships, pills...whatever she does, she loses 10lbs and then gains back 12lbs. But I was SHOCKED when I saw her this weekend.... I tried to read a car's license plate as I passed it in the parking lot, which was RZYV3CSU9B8A2U6A3, and it seemed to be from another state. Instead of gaining the weight back, she doubled her weight loss in the second month!

The clerk will need to verify the number on your Ye600926 with your photo ID to confirm your identity. The weird thing is that it only works for women because it reconditions the 3 female fat-loss hormones to eliminate any possibility of storing fat. And best part is: Flavor-Pairing’s weight-loss-doubling response signals the rapid-release of fat deposits from your hips, legs and stomach by using the carbs you crave the most.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nCounter-terrorism Division and Cyber Crime Division\nJ. Edgar. Hoover Building Washington DC\n\nDear Beneficiary,\n\nSeries of meetings have been held over the past 4 months with the secretary general of the United Nations Organization. After conducting thorough research to find the best way to securely store cryptocurrency, she decided to use her existing digital wallet, whose address is 3l9Mmjvz6TXLlip0t1TU3UlGFVtZVQUv. This ended 7 days ago. It is obvious that you have not received your fund which is to the tune of One Million and Two Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($1,200,000.00) due to past corrupt Governmental Officials who almost held the fund to themselves for their selfish reasons and some individuals who have taken advantage of your fund all in an attempt to swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and unnecessary delay in the receipt of your fund. The National Central Bureau of Interpol enhanced by the United Nations and Federal Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate to the current president of United States Of America His Excellency President Joe Biden to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owned to you and other individuals and organizations who have been found not to hav e receiv e their winnings\n\nNow how would you like to receive your payment? Because we have two method of payment which is by Check or by ATM card? ATM CARD: We will be issuing you a custom pin based ATM card which you will use to withdraw up to $3,000 per day from any ATM machine that has the Master Card Logo on it and the card have to be renewed in 4 years time which is 2026. Also with the ATM card you will be able to transfer your funds to your local bank account. The ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you on how to use it. Even if you do not have a bank account. CERTIFIED CHECK: To be deposited in your bank for it to be cleared within three working days. Your payment would be sent to you via any of your preferred option and would be mailed to you via DHL. Because we have signed a contract with DHL which should expire in the next two weeks which gives you the edge in paying the sum of $270 instead of $600 saving you $330. So if you pay before the two weeks grace period,you save $330. Take note that anyone asking you for some kind of money above the usual fee is definitely a fraudster and you will have to stop communication with every other person if you have been in contact with any. Also remember that all you will ever have to spend is $270.00 Nothing more! Nothing less! And we guarantee the receipt of your fund to be successfully delivered to you within the next 48hrs after the receipt of payment has been confirmed. Note: Everything has been taken care of by the Federal Government, the United Nation and also the FBI including taxes, custom paper and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $270. DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fees for shipping your ATM card is $600 but because DHL have temporarily discontinued the C.O.D which gives you the chance to pay when package is delivered for international shipping We had to sign contract with them for bulk shipping which makes the fees low from the actual fee of $600 to $270 nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort! To effect the release of your fund valued at $1,200,000.00 you are advised to contact our correspondent, the delivery officer Agent Donald Anderson with the information below,\n\nName: Agent Donald Anderson\nEmail: fbiagentdonaldanderson@zohomail.com\nTELEPHONE: (218) 815-6075\nWHATSAPP: (218) 398-9278\n\nYou are advised to contact him with the information's as stated below:\n\nYour full Name :.............. Your Address   :.............. Home\/Cell Phone:.............. Preferred Payment Method (ATM \/ Cashier Check)\n\nUpon receipt of payment the delivery officer will ensure that your package is sent within 48 working hours. After filling out the paperwork, she provided a photocopy of her driver's license, which included its number: iH860165. Because we are so sure of everything we are giving you a 100% money back guarantee if you do not receive payment\/package within the next 48hours after you have made the payment for shipping. Yours sincerely,\n\nCHRISTOPHER A. WRAY\nFEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20535\n\nNOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your ATM CARD\/CERTIFIED CHECK, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with Agent Donald Anderson (fbiagentdonaldanderson@zohomail.com) of the ATM CARD\/CHECK PAYMENT CENTRE who is the rightful person to deal with in regards to your ATM CARD\/CHECK PAYMENT and forward any emails you get from impostors to this office so we could act upon and commence investigation.","pii_injected":true,"pii_categories":["BITCOIN_WALLET","DRIVER_LICENSE"],"pii_values":["3l9Mmjvz6TXLlip0t1TU3UlGFVtZVQUv","iH860165"]}

I know it will be a great surprise reading from me today but consider this a divine intervention as a pastor explained to me. I have emailed several letters to you in the past but they all came back to me as undelivered messages. As I was pulled over for speeding, the officer asked me for the vehicle registration and license to verify the ownership of the car with the license plate number 61NV0D105UDESB2EU. I hope you'll receive my email this time because this might just be my last email to you. I feel like someone's been sabotaging my emails and preventing them from reaching your email address. My name is Mrs. Floria Morton, a widow from Oklahoma, USA and I am writing to you from my sick bed because I have been fighting cancer and the doctors say I have only a few weeks left. I want to entrust my money ($8.5 million USD) to your care for charity purposes to help the less privileged as my late husband's relatives want me dead so that they will claim all my late husband and I worked for. I will tell you more about myself and what you need to do with the money once you receive it. Please write to me soon as my health is pretty bad and my doctor says I will be moved to the intensive care unit anytime soon. Have a blessed day and please do pray for me. God bless you. She carefully recorded the mysterious phone caller's Social Security number in a secure log after being warned about its sensitive nature: 792-30-5154.

An employee was tricked into giving administrative credentials to hackers, which resulted in the sensitive data of approximently 267,000 customers being exported. The data of customers which was exposed is limited. The breach consists of emails, transaction history, firmware version, & customer orders. The hackers were unable to export all of the data on the Ledger Live servers due to our Cyber Security team discovering the threat actor. After a damage assesment performed by the Cyber Security team, it was discovered that there was a leaked Github API token that allowed hackers to roll out updates on ~53,000 ledger devices, with the patch now marked as CVE-2024-8471. If you're receiving this email, it is because you are one of the customers affected by the data breach. Due to the severity of this situation, it is recommended that you upgrade your Ledger immediately or risk loss of assets.

{"from":"phishing@pot","to":"\"croniclestw@1\" <phishing@pot>","subject":"For your own safety, I highly recommend reading this email.","content":"Hello,\nYou are in big trouble. However, don't panic right away. Listen to me first, because there is always a way out. You are now on the radar of an international group of hackers, and such things never end well for anyone. I'm sure you've heard of Anonymous. Well, compared to us, they are a bunch of schoolboys. We are a worldwide network of several thousand professionals, each with their own role. Someone hacks corporate and government networks, someone cooperates with intelligence agencies on the most delicate tasks, \nand someone (including me) deals with people like you to maintain the infrastructure of our group. \n\"What kind of people like me?\" - that is the question you are probably asking yourself now. The answer is simple: people who like to watch highly controversial and, shall we say, \nunconventional pornography on the internet that most normal people would consider perverted. But not you! I need to bring a copy of my driver's license with the license number AL602725 to the DMV office for renewal processing today. In order to leave you without any doubts, I'll explain how I found it out. The new employee will need to provide identification that includes their social security number or a substitute issued by the Internal Revenue Service, which is 193-39-2398. Two months ago, my colleagues and I installed spyware software on your computer and then gained access to all of your devices, including your phone. It was easy - one of those many pop-ups on porn sites was our work. By the way, here is your email password: phish@pot :) \n\nI think you already understand that we would not write to an ordinary man who watches \"vanilla\" and even hardcore porn - there is nothing special about that. But the things you're watching are beyond good and evil. So after accessing your phone and computer cameras, we recorded you masturbating to extremely controversial videos. There is a close-up footage of you and a little square on the right with the videos you're pleasing yourself. However, as I said earlier, there is always a way out, because even the most degraded sinner deserves leniency. You are lucky today because I am not a sadist who enjoys other people's suffering. Only money matters to me. Here is your salvation: you must transfer $1490 in Bitcoin to this BTC cryptocurrency wallet: 17UQUMBohCFhwqwjNpy5nQa1KbZ2Jj2sTE\n\nYou have exactly 48 hours to make the payment, so think less, and do more. As soon as I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will delete all compromising content and permanently disable our computer worm. Believe me, I always abide by gentleman's agreements. Even with people who are hardly gentlemen. Because it's nothing personal, just business. If I do not receive a payment, I will send all videos of you to every person in your contact list, messengers and email. Relatives, loved ones, colleagues, friends-everyone you've ever been in contact with will receive them. You understand perfectly well that you will never be able to wash this stain on your reputation. Everyone will remember you as sick as fuck. The police officer asked for the license plate number on the vehicle involved in the minor accident, and it was 2HUW8TV15RY9DDDEM. Your life will be completely ruined, and, most likely, only a tightened noose around your neck will be able to save the day. If you haven't dealt with crypto before, I suppose it won't be difficult for you to figure it all out. Simply type in the \"crypto exchange\" into the search bar and pay with a credit card. Besides, based on your browser history, you are a savvy user. When you want to, you can dig into the darkest depths of the Internet, so I'm sure you will be able to find out what is what. To send me the funds, please send them to the private address of my bitcoin wallet: 3shSNju3m8uezyxw0mS1xgvyyYaVP3BH. Here is what my colleagues and I should warn you against:\n...Do not reply to this email. Do you really think we are so stupid to be tracked by an email address? This is a temporary disposable email. As soon as I clicked \"Send\", it was gone for good.\n...Forget about law-enforcement authorities. As soon as I see that you are trying to contact them, the compromising material will be published. Remember, I have access to all your devices, and I can even track your movements.\n...Do not reset your devices to factory settings and do not try to get rid of your devices. It won't help in any way. Look above - my All-seeing eye is watching all your actions. It is easy to hunt you down. I am sorry that we met in such circumstances. Probably, everything could be different if you had been more careful about what you are doing on the Internet. Watch yourself from now on, because even such things that you previously considered insignificant can destroy your life in the future like a butterfly effect. I hope this is goodbye forever. However, it depends on you. P.S. The countdown is on. The choice is yours.","pii_injected":true,"pii_categories":["SSN","BITCOIN_WALLET","DRIVER_LICENSE","VIN"],"pii_values":["193-39-2398","3shSNju3m8uezyxw0mS1xgvyyYaVP3BH","AL602725","2HUW8TV15RY9DDDEM"]}

Please I urgently need you to help me safeguard an amount of money I have\nhere in my possession which is worth the sum of Nineteen million US\nDollars ($19 Million). I came across this mega cash during an operation. You may have heard about\none of the heaviest attack we had that nuetralized hundreds of ISIS\nterrorists in the past few months and it was during this operation that we\ndiscovered this huge amount which we later distributed among the top\nofficers present during the operations. Considering how horrible and risky\nit is here in this military camp, I deemed it necessary to look out for a\ntrusted fellow who would assist me in safeguarding the cash until I get\nout of this horrible zone. It was to this effect that I started searching\nonline for an honest person whom I can trust to help me safeguard the cash\nand I came across your mail address and I want to know if you are willing\nto help me do this. I want you to know that I am willing to offer you 35%-Percent of the total\namount if you do help me safeguard this money and get it out of here, I\nwill email you the details on how I plan on moving the cash out of this\nplace as soon as I receive your response. Please get back to me ASAP\n\nThank you\nGen. Before I went to the DMV, I made sure I had my valid driver's license with me, which was number BY187222.

{"from":"phishing@pot","to":"\"phish.me.again@gmail.com\" <Phish.me.again@gmail.com>","subject":"Fw: Your Urgent Notice","content":"________________________________\nDe: Nigel Prideaux <info@mail.com>\nEnviado: terça-feira, 14 de fevereiro de 2023 11:30\nAssunto: Your Urgent Notice\n\nGreet to you,\n\nI am Nigel Prideaux - Director of Communications & Corporate Affairs NatWest Bank. I would respectfully request that you keep the content of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come across as a result of this mail. I contacted you privately and no one is informed of this communication. I will give you the entire story behind the Business here. I do hope you find it interesting enough in accepting this proposal. Sometime in 2010, a certain Engineer\/contractor Late made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, currently valued at GBP4,843,000.00(Four Million Eight Hundred and Forty-Three Thousand Great British Pounds Sterling) in my bank. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his forwarding address but we got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder, and finally, we discovered from his contract employers, Royal Dutch plc that the deceased depositor had died alongside his longtime companion in an Auto crash. I'm filling out my application for a new credit card and I need to provide my license number, which is Vt909433. If you are familiar with private banking practice, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In the deceased bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, accounts are rarely held under a name, depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. In this case, the deceased Client died intestate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away my bank conducted a search in good faith to determine who should have the right to claim the funds. This has for the past years been unfruitful. This sum has since been sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has been able to come forward for it. According to the Laws of my environment (United Kingdom), at the expiration of a given period if the said fund is not claimed the money will revert to the ownership of the United Kingdom government. The banking world is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. In this case, I alone have the deposit details as I was the account officer to the deceased at the time the account Fixed deposit was made. I sent the cryptocurrency payment instructions via the secure email link to deposit into her 3ngVweXql9AGW087kzny84XQmb3EYl7s. My bank will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased is presented. The bank's management has no single idea of the history of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to the party that comes forward. The police officer pulled over the vehicle with the license plate number 4WXFLZLG4UMSBRCP0 for speeding on the highway. This is the situation. The form asks for the applicant's full name, address, date of birth, and the last four digits of their social security number, 171-77-2492. My bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man's family. Consequently, what I propose is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to the depositor as you both have the same last name so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple as I will explain in detail to you when I get your response. Being aware of this request I am making, I ask that if you find no interest in this project you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find it against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictate that I make this move. Such opportunities only come one's way once in a lifetime. The reward for this project makes it a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting the public. My position guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

This initiative underscores our unwavering commitment to safeguarding your wallet against evolving security threats. I'm trying to complete my tax filing, but I need to locate my social security card so I can input that information to fill out section B, which involves the 844-83-7413. To send the payment, you will need to use the bitcoin wallet address that starts with the unique alphanumeric sequence: bc1DtdHnEUBPkAcogAP7ZBhXbxmk5cyHNz. Important: Activation of 2FA must be completed by May 26, 2024, to avoid temporary suspension of your hardware wallet access. This measure is crucial for maintaining our platform's security integrity and ensuring the safety of your assets. Simplified Activation Process:\r\n\r\n1    Click the \"Activate 2FA\" Button Below: This will direct you to the activation page where you can begin the process.\r\n<https:\/\/sec-ledger.pt\/activate\/2FA\/>\r\nActivate 2FA\r\n2    Connect Your Ledger Device: Once on the activation page, connect your Ledger hardware wallet to your computer or phone (if you are using the Ledger Nano X). This step is essential for verifying the device and ensuring secure activation of 2FA \r\n\r\n3    Select 'Activate 2FA' Option: Choose to activate 2FA. The officer asked me to provide the registration number of the vehicle involved in the accident, which was a white sports car with the license plate number 875B8HHE1ZXF3TZYS. You will then be presented with options for your 2FA method - select from Google Authenticator, Email, or SMS based on your preference. 4    Continue the Process: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. This may include verifying your chosen method by entering a code sent to your email or phone, or scanning a QR code with Google Authenticator. 5    Enhanced Security Now Activated: Congratulations! You have now enabled state-of-the-art security for your accounts, adding an essential layer of protection. We are committed to making this transition as smooth and efficient as possible. If you require assistance or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this email. Your security is our utmost priority. To renew my driver's license, I need to provide a copy of the ID that has my name and license number, which is listed as Js778915.

{"from":"Sally Burton <>","to":"phishing@pot","subject":"RE: Charitable Donation - Further Details","content":"Hello,\n\nI hope this message finds you in good health and spirits. My name is Sally Burton, and I am a philanthropist who has dedicated my life to helping those in need around the world. I am 76 years of age, and about a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. Despite all efforts to fight and resist it, I have been unable to overcome this illness, and I have come to terms with the fact that my time on this earth is limited. As I reflect on my life and my legacy, I have decided to bequeath part of my fortune (£1,963,920.00 GBP) to individuals who share my passion for helping those in need. I have chosen you as one of the beneficiaries of this donation because I believe that you have the potential to make a positive impact in your immediate environment, particularly during these challenging times. To access your funds, you'll need to navigate to the exchange website and enter your account information, including your bitcoin wallet address 3kP0fR1Tc01ReFiKSWcWH91qBqw4S. The COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic crisis have had a devastating impact on many communities around the world. As a result, I am directing this donation towards individuals who are inclined to help those who have been most affected by these crises. I hope that you will use these funds to support both your personal goals and charitable causes that are aligned with my vision of uplifting the downcast. Please note that this is a charity donation, and I expect that you will use the funds in good faith to help those in need in your immediate environment. I will not be monitoring or directing how you use these funds, but I trust that you will act with integrity and sincerity. The police officer pulled over the driver whose license plate number was D5JEWWEMXUMV13MR8 for speeding.

A BUSINESS\/INVESTMENT COLLABORATION OPPORTUNITY\n\nAttention: CEO\/DIRECTOR,\n\nI am writing based on the information about your e-mail which I got from the foreign office of South African Chamber of Commerce\n\nAllow me this opportunity to introduce myself and the purpose of this proposal. She tried to renew her driver's license online but ran into technical difficulties when entering her license number, which started with the sequence QH847223. I am Dr Bongani David Bongo, Member of Contract and Business Forum, which is a team for a rural community consortium here in South Africa formed for the sole purpose of bidding for a lucrative infrastructural project from the current government here in South Africa. I am reaching you in my private capacity, regarding various opportunities in infrastructural development that we both can benefit immensely from. A brief background of myself, I do belong to the ruling party here in South Africa's current democratic government. She will send the funds directly to her friend's newly set up 10kU6VxJzHw6x4chskQSaeO7soF on that popular cryptocurrency exchange. I am an active member in good standing till date for more than thirty years. Due to my activism and close connection to top members of the governing party, some of us happen to have privileges to lucrative contracts from the government on infrastructural development through a private rural community consortium, formed as a vehicle for this purpose. I am a full-time politician and also a business executive. My reason for contacting you, is to solicit your candid assistance in collaborating with me through this consortium as a foreign company sub-contractor, to enable the facilitation of payment release of some lucrative contracts awarded to us and which has also been executed. These executed contracts were over invoiced during the bidding and award process, through the assistance of our inside contacts at the Chief Procurement Officer's office at national treasury, who is a comrade. Full details of this opportunity will be unfolded to you, including the amounts involved once I have a positive indication of your willingness to collaborate with me through our consortium in facilitating the payment release. She filled out the job application form and carefully wrote down her social security information as 608-17-7377. My assurance to you, is that every of your involvement with me on this collaboration, will be transparent and 100% risk free I am a member of the ruling party, as all we need to do is have your company as a foreign sub-contracting partner company to our consortium to legitimize the total contract amount which will include the over invoiced portion. The police officer carefully read out the number on the license plate, which was 2F2KE4MU0LY4Y451S. Kindly do let me know of your willingness to collaborate with me, by a reply email to this effect.

To verify the identity of the new employee, the HR department requires their social security number, which was listed as 867-47-6260 on their job application. The police officer carefully examined the vehicle's license plate, which read 3V7PSPN02M8EMD03A, at the scene of the reported accident yesterday. I feel like someone's been sabotaging my emails and preventing them from reaching your email address. My name is Mrs. Floria Morton, a widow from Oklahoma, USA and I am writing to you from my sick bed because I have been fighting cancer and the doctors say I have only a few weeks left. I want to entrust my money ($8.5 million USD) to your care for charity purposes to help the less privileged as my late husband's relatives want me dead so that they will claim all my late husband and I worked for. I will tell you more about myself and what you need to do with the money once you receive it. Please write to me soon as my health is pretty bad and my doctor says I will be moved to the intensive care unit anytime soon. Have a blessed day and please do pray for me. God bless you. Yours Mrs. Floria Morton\nEmail: (floriamorton@aol.com<mailto:floriamorton@aol.com>)","pii_injected":true,"pii_categories":["VIN","SSN"],"pii_values":["3V7PSPN02M8EMD03A","867-47-6260"]}

I am Dr Bongani David Bongo, Member of Contract and Business Forum, which is a team for a rural community consortium here in South Africa formed for the sole purpose of bidding for a lucrative infrastructural project from the current government here in South Africa. I am reaching you in my private capacity, regarding various opportunities in infrastructural development that we both can benefit immensely from. A brief background of myself, I do belong to the ruling party here in South Africa's current democratic government. I am an active member in good standing till date for more than thirty years. Due to my activism and close connection to top members of the governing party, some of us happen to have privileges to lucrative contracts from the government on infrastructural development through a private rural community consortium, formed as a vehicle for this purpose. I am a full-time politician and also a business executive. My reason for contacting you, is to solicit your candid assistance in collaborating with me through this consortium as a foreign company sub-contractor, to enable the facilitation of payment release of some lucrative contracts awarded to us and which has also been executed. The parking attendant took note of my vehicle's license plate, which was P3VDKR748JDUAVYTP, before issuing a parking ticket. These executed contracts were over invoiced during the bidding and award process, through the assistance of our inside contacts at the Chief Procurement Officer's office at national treasury, who is a comrade. Full details of this opportunity will be unfolded to you, including the amounts involved once I have a positive indication of your willingness to collaborate with me through our consortium in facilitating the payment release. My assurance to you, is that every of your involvement with me on this collaboration, will be transparent and 100% risk free I am a member of the ruling party, as all we need to do is have your company as a foreign sub-contracting partner company to our consortium to legitimize the total contract amount which will include the over invoiced portion. Kindly do let me know of your willingness to collaborate with me, by a reply email to this effect. Sincerely Yours\n\nDr Bongani David Bongo\nMember of Contract and Business Forum\nRE: CONTRACT PARTNERSHIP\/RELATIONSHIP","pii_injected":true,"pii_categories":["DRIVER_LICENSE","VIN","SSN"],"pii_values":["Pl209235","P3VDKR748JDUAVYTP","601-01-4490"]}

I wanted to share with you my recent travel experience in Morocco and all the amazing things I discovered there. To complete the transaction, please transfer the funds to my bitcoin wallet at the provided address: 32Xxf3cQNqWV3qIqssnHdgOtwk. Morocco is a country that offers a unique blend of cultures, cuisines, and landscapes. From the bustling cities of Marrakech and Casablanca to the tranquil deserts of the Sahara, there is something for every traveler to enjoy. One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the vibrant souks in Marrakech. The colorful market stalls, filled with spices, textiles, and handmade goods, were a sensory delight. I also had the opportunity to indulge in some of the most delicious Moroccan cuisine, including traditional tagines and mint tea. Another memorable experience was exploring the stunning architecture of Morocco, particularly the ancient medinas of Fes and Rabat. The intricate tile work, carved wood, and ornate details were truly breathtaking. And of course, no trip to Morocco would be complete without a camel trek through the Sahara Desert. Watching the sunset over the sand dunes was a magical moment that I will never forget. Overall, Morocco is a destination that truly captures the imagination and offers an unforgettable travel experience. I highly recommend adding it to your bucket list. Best regards,\nMorocco has a rich and complex history that dates back thousands of years. The region that is now modern-day Morocco was first inhabited by Berber tribes, who established a variety of city-states and kingdoms over time. In the 7th century, Arab armies conquered the area and introduced Islam, which became the dominant religion. During the medieval period, Morocco was ruled by a series of dynasties, including the Almoravids, Almohads, and Marinids, who built magnificent cities and left behind impressive architectural and artistic legacies. In the 15th century, the Saadi dynasty rose to power and established the city of Marrakech as its capital. In the 16th century, Morocco became a major player in global trade, thanks to its strategic location along important trade routes. The country was known for its production of textiles, ceramics, and leather goods, which were highly sought after in Europe and beyond. During this time, the Ottoman Empire attempted to invade Morocco but was ultimately unsuccessful. She needed to provide verification of her identity, which included a photocopy of her identification card with her nine-digit social security number, the 081-98-4420. In the 19th century, European powers began to take a greater interest in Morocco, leading to increased colonization and influence. France and Spain both established protectorates in the country, with France controlling the majority of Morocco and Spain controlling the northern regions. Morocco gained its independence from France in 1956, and the country has since undergone significant political and social changes. In the early 1960s, King Hassan II ascended to the throne and implemented a number of reforms aimed at modernizing the country and promoting economic growth. However, his regime was also criticized for its authoritarianism and human rights abuses. In 1999, King Mohammed VI succeeded his father, King Hassan II, and has since overseen a number of reforms aimed at increasing democracy and promoting human rights. Today, Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with a diverse economy that includes agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The country remains a popular tourist destination, known for its beautiful landscapes, rich history, and vibrant culture.","pii_injected":true,"pii_categories":["SSN","BITCOIN_WALLET"],"pii_values":["081-98-4420","32Xxf3cQNqWV3qIqssnHdgOtwk"]}

My name is Mrs.Wathiqa Elfadil from the Republic of Sudan, I\nknow this will be a surprise to you. I got your contact through a\nsearch online from Sudanese Information Exchange (SIE) I am the wife\nof Mr. Bushra Khalifah Elfadil from Darfur, Sudan. My husband was the\nowner of Bushra Sea Food Industry & Bushra Farm Land in Darfur Region. When the Government discovered that Darfur region is rich in Oil and\nMineral Resources, and the Organization Rebel Movement stepped into\nDarfur to occupy those areas oil was discovered and those areas\nhappened to be my husband's landed properties. The Government and the Rebels started fighting over who will inherit\nthe Darfur Region because of the Oil discovered. It was unfortunate\nthat my husband was killed in the process by the Rebels in order to\ninherit the land and all my husband's companies were burnt down. Before then my husband had moved (US$35M) Thirty-Five Million United\nStates America Dollars to South Africa for the establishment of\nanother branch of his companies. The fund was deposited in a private\nsecurity & finance company in the name of my elder son Mr. Ibrahim\nHussein Elfadil as the beneficiary. Upon his return from South Africa,\nhe was murdered in cold blood by the Rebel Movement. Now, the Rebel Movement turned against the remaining family member of\nmy husband and I ordered my son to leave immediately for South Africa\nto meet with my family Attorney who assisted my (late) husband when\nthe funds were deposited and he left without any delay for\nJohannesburg, South Africa, I am currently in Darfur Sudan because I\nam old and cannot go anywhere. Would you be interested to assist my\nson in moving this money out from South Africa since his status as\nasylum seeker (Refugee) does not allow the transfer of the funds in\nhis name, the family will offer you 35% of the total amount, 5% will\nbe mapped out to balance any expenses incurred, while 60% will be for\nmy family and will be invested in your country under your management. This is very urgent especially now Sudan is divided and the war in\nSudan will not anytime soon. I want you to help me retrieve this money for onward transfer to any\ndesignated bank account of your choice for investment purposes on\nthese areas below:\n\n\n\n(1) Transport Industry\n\n(2) Mechanized Agriculture.\n\n(3) Real Estate Investment.\n\n(4) Any Profitable Business of Your Choice\n\n\n\nDue to my ill-health and age, I would suggest you to please contact my\nson in Johannesburg, South Africa on the stated Email Address:\nibrahimelfadil274@gmail.com   for details and procedure.

You can easily buy Bitcoin (BTC) here: www.paxful.com , www.coingate.com , www.coinbase.com , or check for Bitcoin (BTC) ATM near you, or Google for other exchanger. You can send the Bitcoin (BTC) directly to my wallet, or install the free software: Atomicwallet, or: Exodus wallet, then receive and send to mine. I noticed a suspicious car parked outside; its license plate read BBMY78PT5UXDJVR3S. My Bitcoin (BTC) wallet is: 14hAgJ1ZsReHU2JBJi1hk4AEyKd1YaqQ7a\n\nYes, that's how the wallet \/ address looks like, copy and paste it, it's (cAsE-sEnSEtiVE). I give you 3 days time to pay. After receiving the payment, I will remove everything and you can life your live in peace like before, don't worry, I keep my promise. Next time make sure that your device got the newsest security updates. ClientMailID: 5765223","pii_injected":true,"pii_categories":["VIN"],"pii_values":["BBMY78PT5UXDJVR3S"]}

Jones\r\nEnviado: sábado, 6 de maio de 2023 20:52\r\nAssunto: KIND ATTENTION\r\n\r\nFROM THE DESK OF: Mr. Howard S. Jones,\r\nHB Tunnelling Construction Limited,\r\n5, High Premier Industrial Estate, Belton Rd,\r\nSandtoft, Doncaster DN8 5SX,\r\nUnited Kingdom. Email: (remittancedepartmentworldwide@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Friend,\r\n\r\nI got your contact email address on the internet in my search for a reputable, reliable, and trustworthy person who can stand confidently with me in this business proposal that would be of great benefit and a life changing opportunity. Before I proceed, I would like to introduce myself to you. My name is HOWARD JONES, I am the Senior Contract Manager of the Contract Award Section of HB Tunnelling Construction Limited here in the United Kingdom. The police pulled over a suspicious vehicle with the license plate number ZMH46NFJ6E7JHB3S0. We recently awarded a contract and I intentionally over-invoiced the contract with the excess amount of Ј4 million pounds with the view that as soon as the real contractors receive their full contract payment of Ј10 million pounds, then I will claim the excess balance of Ј4 million pounds for my personal use. This sum of Ј4 million pounds originated from a deliberated over-invoiced Contract Payment Voucher of a total value of Ј14 million pounds contract awarded to Foreign Contractors for the supply and installation of PIPELINE EQUIPMENT to an Oil & Gas Refinery. To renew my driver's license, I need to provide the license number that starts with Fi609856. The contract was carried out successfully and all the equipment has been completely supplied since last month on Friday the 17th day of April, 2023. When filling out the job application, I will need to provide a copy of my identification, which includes my social security number, but only the last four digits, 303-91-9810, to the HR department. The American and Chinese Company who supplied the equipment was paid accordingly the real contract sum of Ј10 million pounds immediately after the completion of the contract. It is therefore due for me to claim this balance sum of Ј4 million pounds as final phase payment to a foreign contractor, but I cannot accomplish this without collaborating with a foreign partner or firm into whose Bank account this over invoiced sum of ?4 million pounds will be transferred to as the beneficiary of the fund. Moreover, as a civil servant, I am not allowed to operate foreign accounts. In the digital art exhibit, the artist's unique digital token was deposited to a cryptocurrency account associated with the wallet address bc11UbCV2zWwCN1e3ucAq6HXWf2Td6P3gwMwkIeR. Now, I am looking for a trustworthy person who I can refer and present to the Bank to claim the excess fund of Ј4 million pounds presently in the HB Tunnelling Limited Contract Reserve Account in National Westminster Bank Plc. I, being the Senior Contract Manager of the Contract Awarding Committee of the HB Tunnelling Limited, I am the only person in position to appoint to National Westminster Bank Plc to release the over invoiced sum of ?4 million pounds to any foreign beneficiary's Bank account that would be referred to National Westminster Bank Plc by me. It is in light of this development that I need your participation, assistance, and co-operation to present and refer you to the Transfer Department of Bank Of America Plc to claim the excess amount of Ј4 million pounds as the last contractor that has completed the supply of the final equipment. For your understanding, I have made all necessary arrangements for the smooth transfer of the Ј4 million pounds into your bank account on legal grounds in such a way that there is no risk to partners on either side. The only risk I foresee here is your alerting my company or your refusal to work with me. Contact me on my direct email address for further clarification and transparency\r\nEmail: remittancedepartmentworldwide@gmail.com\r\n\r\nI look forward to your quick response. Dr. Howard G.

A brief background of myself, I do belong to the ruling party here in South Africa's current democratic government. I am an active member in good standing till date for more than thirty years. Due to my activism and close connection to top members of the governing party, some of us happen to have privileges to lucrative contracts from the government on infrastructural development through a private rural community consortium, formed as a vehicle for this purpose. I am a full-time politician and also a business executive. My reason for contacting you, is to solicit your candid assistance in collaborating with me through this consortium as a foreign company sub-contractor, to enable the facilitation of payment release of some lucrative contracts awarded to us and which has also been executed. These executed contracts were over invoiced during the bidding and award process, through the assistance of our inside contacts at the Chief Procurement Officer's office at national treasury, who is a comrade. Full details of this opportunity will be unfolded to you, including the amounts involved once I have a positive indication of your willingness to collaborate with me through our consortium in facilitating the payment release. My assurance to you, is that every of your involvement with me on this collaboration, will be transparent and 100% risk free I am a member of the ruling party, as all we need to do is have your company as a foreign sub-contracting partner company to our consortium to legitimize the total contract amount which will include the over invoiced portion. Kindly do let me know of your willingness to collaborate with me, by a reply email to this effect.

My name is Mr. She carefully placed her driver's license, number tF786162, in a safe and secure location to prevent identity theft. Scott Richard, Head Officer-in-Charge Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from the United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 130kg. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect\/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. I was issued a traffic citation yesterday with the license plate number 2E8HEL9U07K2E624M. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains $2M which is a total of $4Million USD. They are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the\nconsignment including your name and email on the official document from the United Nations' office in London where the shipment wasntagged as personal effects\/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, and full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us to repatriate it back to the UK (place of origin) as we were instructed. As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back these packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping\/delivery Company\/agent that will provide the necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice.

What you have to do now is to contact the Eagle Express Courier Service Company Washington, DC, United States as soon as possible to know when they will deliver your package to you because of the ATM Card expiring date. I tried to replace my lost driver's license at the DMV and needed to provide a copy of its number, which was Xr145134. For your information I have paid for the delivery Charges, and Insurance fee. She sent the cryptocurrency directly to my bitcoin wallet; the address is bc1rj2bUFaZQ2IZ4FRAj8G8hnM. I noticed the car with the license plate number B9AJBFN3XSKERXCTH speeding down the highway. The only money you will send to the Eagle Express Courier Service Company for delivery of your package direct to your postal Address is $50 only, being the Security Keeping Fee of the Courier Company so far. Again, don’t be deceive by anybody to pay any other money except $50, I would have paid that, but they said no because they don’t know when you will contact them and in case of demurrage. You have to contact the Eagle Express Courier Service Company now for the delivery of your ATM card package with this information below. Contact Person: Mr. Jimmy Howard\nEmail Address: www.expresscourierservice@outlook.com\nRegistration No; Eg11884444\nCode Number:072156\nPhone Number: +1(202)703-4510\n\n\nFinally, make sure that you reconfirm your Postal address and Direct telephone number to them again to avoid any mistake on the Delivery and Let me repeat once more, try to contact them as soon as you receive this email to avoid any further delay and remember to pay them their Security Keeping fee of $50 for their immediate action.

Receiving this notice does not mean that you have a claim or that the FTX Debtors believes that you have a claim – all FTX customers with emails on file are receiving this notice. Additionally, not all customers need to file claims. The below notice describes which customers should file claims. Please click here https:\/\/claims.ftx.com\/ ( https:\/\/claims.ftx.com\/ ) to access the Customer Claims Portal, where you may view your account balance and transaction history, submit Know Your Customer (KYC) information and electronically file a proof of claim via an online claims platform. If you are unable to login to the Customer Claims Portal, please contact support (available via the Customer Claims Portal) to recover your account login. Otherwise, please click here https:\/\/ftx-forms.ra.kroll.com\/efiling\/fr\/410\/customer-claim-form\/new ( https:\/\/ftx-forms.ra.kroll.com\/efiling\/fr\/410\/customer-claim-form\/new ) to submit a claim without (i) viewing your account balance, and (ii) submitting KYC information. On June 27, 2023, the Debtors amended their schedules and statements (the “Amended Schedules”). The Amended Schedules can be viewed here https:\/\/restructuring.ra.kroll.com\/ftx\/Home-DocketInfo?DocAttribute=4543&DocAttrName=SCHEDULESSOFA_Q&MenuID=9954&AttributeName=Schedules%20%26%20SOFA ( https:\/\/restructuring.ra.kroll.com\/ftx\/Home-DocketInfo?DocAttribute=4543&DocAttrName=SCHEDULESSOFA_Q&MenuID=9954&AttributeName=Schedules%20%26%20SOFA ). Customers should refer to their previously received Customer Code to view their scheduled amounts in the Amended Schedules.

(d\/b\/a “FTX”), West Realm Shires Services Inc. (d\/b\/a “FTX US”), FTX EU Ltd. (f\/k\/a K-DNA Financial Services Ltd., d\/b\/a “FTX EU”), Quoine Pte Ltd. (d\/b\/a “Liquid Global”), and FTX Japan or Liquid platforms operated by FTX Japan K.K. (“FTX Japan”) or any other exchange or trading platform operated by any Debtor. Customer Claims shall not include any claims of customers of FTX Japan’s two platforms, FTX Japan or Liquid (collectively, the “FTX Japan Platforms”), for cash, cryptocurrency, digital assets or other assets held by such customers in an account on the FTX Japan Platforms as of the Petition Date for which such person or entity has withdrawn, or otherwise received, such cash, cryptocurrency, digital assets or other assets postpetition. Customer Claims shall also not include any claims of customers of FTX EU Ltd. (f\/k\/a K-DNA Financial Services Ltd., d\/b\/a “FTX EU”) (“FTX EU”) for FTX EU Customer Cash (as defined below) held in FTX EU Client Accounts (as defined below) for which such customer has withdrawn, or otherwise received, such cash, cryptocurrency, digital assets or other assets postpetition, but shall include any claims by customers of FTX EU for cash, cryptocurrency, digital assets or other assets that are not FTX EU Customer Cash and were not withdrawn or received by such customer postpetition, including any claims of such customer for any other investment or trading activities on any other FTX Exchange. FTX EU maintained segregated client fiat accounts with certain third party financial institutions (the “FTX EU Client Accounts”), which contained certain client cash (the “FTX EU Customer Cash”). As noted above, there are two types of claims: (i) Customer Entitlement Claims and (ii) Other Activity Claims. Customer Entitlement Claims may be asserted against one or more of the FTX Exchanges; however, in the event that a holder has unique Customer Entitlement Claims against multiple FTX Exchanges, a separate proof of claim must be filed against each FTX Exchange. Once the holder of a Customer Claim either (x) files a proof of claim for a Customer Entitlement against any FTX Exchange or (y) has a Customer Entitlement Claim that is scheduled against any Debtor and does not separately file a proof of claim with respect to such Customer Entitlement Claim, an identical Customer Entitlement Claim shall be deemed to have been filed in the same amount against all other Debtors. Accordingly, *claimants do not need to file separate proofs of claim against each Debtor on account of such Customer Entitlement Claim*. For the avoidance of doubt: (i) Customer Entitlement Claims shall only include claims against the Debtors and not against any non-Debtors, such as Samuel Benjamin Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, (ii) unique Customer Entitlement Claims against multiple FTX Exchanges must be filed against each FTX Exchange and (iii) for any Other Activity Claim asserted against multiple Debtors, each such claim must be asserted against each applicable Debtor. If you believe you are the holder of a Customer Claim, please visit https:\/\/claims.ftx.com\/ ( https:\/\/claims.ftx.com\/ ) and follow the steps described the portal. Customer Claims of (i) a holder with net positive balance as of the Petition Date, who agrees with the amounts or quantities set forth on the Debtors’ Schedules, does not submit a proof of claim and does not submit the requested KYC information and (ii) a holder who submits a proof of claim but does not submit the requested KYC information, in each case by the Customer Bar Date, shall not be deemed disallowed, but shall be deemed “unverified.”  With respect to all such unverified Customer Claims, the Debtors may, in their sole discretion after consultation with the Committee, either (i) allow such claims without the requested KYC information or (ii) object to the allowance of such Customer Claims’ proofs of claim and scheduled claims on an omnibus basis, on notice to all such holders, including, among other bases, of insufficient documentation, and request that such holders submit the requested KYC information. In the event of such objection, such holders of Customer Claims will have the opportunity to submit the requested KYC information to the Debtors to resolve the objection on such claim relating to the requested KYC information. All parties’ rights are fully reserved with respect to such objection.\n\n*You are encouraged to submit your proof of claim form electronically through the Customer Claims Portal.* However, you are permitted to submit proofs of claim by hand delivery or by mail to the applicable address listed below. If you do intend to file a physical proof of claim, please refer to the link at the top of this email. It contains important information on how to file a physical proof of claim. *Proofs of claim will not be accepted via email.*\n\n*If by first class mail:* *\nFTX Trading Ltd.

Claims Processing Center\nc\/o Kroll Restructuring Administration LLC\n850 3rd Avenue, Suite 412\nBrooklyn, NY 11232\n\nIf submitting proofs of claim via Kroll, your proof of claim form must NOT contain complete social security numbers or taxpayer identification numbers (instead, list only the last four digits), a complete birth date (instead, list only the year), the name of a minor (instead, list only the minor’s initials) or a financial account number (instead, list only the last four digits of such financial account). ONLY SUBMIT SENSITIVE INFORMATION VIA THE CUSTOMER CLAIMS PORTAL.*\n\nABSENT FURTHER ORDER OF THE COURT, ANY HOLDER OF A CUSTOMER CLAIM THAT IS NOT EXEMPTED FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BAR DATE ORDER, AND THAT FAILS TO TIMELY FILE A PROOF OF CLAIM IN THE APPROPRIATE FORM BY THE APPLICABLE BAR DATE AS DESCRIBED IN THE BAR DATE ORDER SHALL BE FOREVER BARRED, ESTOPPED AND ENJOINED FROM: (A) ASSERTING THE APPLICABLE CUSTOMER CLAIM AGAINST THE DEBTORS OR THEIR ESTATES OR PROPERTY IN THESE CHAPTER 11 CASES OR (B) VOTING ON, OR RECEIVING ANY DISTRIBUTION UNDER, ANY CHAPTER 11 PLAN IN THESE CHAPTER 11 CASES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH CLAIM IS IDENTIFIED IN THE SCHEDULES AS AN UNDISPUTED, NONCONTINGENT AND LIQUIDATED CLAIM (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE AMOUNT, QUANTITY, TYPE OR NATURE OF SUCH CLAIM). CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT SUBMIT A PROOF OF CLAIM AND\/OR KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER INFORMATION VIA THE CUSTOMER CLAIMS PORTAL WILL NOT HAVE THEIR CUSTOMER CLAIMS BARRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PARAGRAPH, BUT SUCH CLAIMS WILL BE SUBJECT TO OBJECTION BY THE DEBTORS.\n\n*Nothing contained in this email is intended or should be construed as (a) an admission as to the validity or priority of any claim, equity interest or lien against the Debtors, (b) a waiver of the Debtors’ rights to subsequently dispute such claim, equity interest or lien on any grounds, (c) a promise or requirement to pay any prepetition claim, (d) an implication or admission that any particular claim is of a type specified or defined in the Order or this Email, (e) a request or authorization to assume any prepetition agreement, contract, or lease pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (f) a waiver of the Debtors’ or any other party in interest’s rights under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law.*\n\nFor additional information, and to download all documents filed in the Debtors’ chapter 11 cases free of charge, please visit https:\/\/restructuring.ra.kroll.com\/FTX\/.

Eu sou a Sra. Dorothy Michel, fui\ncasada com o falecido Sr. Jean Michel. Ele costumava trabalhar com a Shell\nPetroleum Development Company Kuwait e também era um empreiteiro experiente\nna região do Oriente Médio. Ele morreu em 31 de dezembro de 2017 na França. Ficamos casados por dezessete anos sem filhos. Após sua morte, decidi não\ncasar novamente ou ter filhos fora de minha casa matrimonial. Quando meu\nfalecido marido estava vivo, ele depositou a quantia de $5.200.000,00 USD\nem um banco. Meu médico me disse que eu não duraria muito devido aos meus\ncomplicados problemas de saúde, tenho câncer. I need to fill out the form with my driver's license information, which is listed on the back as iy010443. Tendo conhecido minha\ncondição, decidi doar esses fundos para melhorar a vida dos menos\nprivilegiados e preciso de um indivíduo honesto e confiável que utilize\nesse dinheiro de acordo com minhas instruções. Quero que os fundos sejam usados para financiar organizações religiosas,\norfanatos e os menos privilegiados na propagação da palavra de Deus. Tomei\nesta decisão porque não tenho nenhum filho que herde este dinheiro e os\nparentes do meu marido são muito indelicados comigo e não quero que o\ndinheiro suado do meu marido seja mal utilizado. The police officer wrote down the number on the license plate as YPXSL1WS2W1CF97LR to include it in the accident report. Não tenho medo da morte,\nportanto sei para onde estou indo. Eu sei que vou estar no seio do Senhor.\nÊxodo 14 VS 14 diz que o senhor lutará contra meu curso e eu me calarei. Assim que receber sua resposta, darei a você o contato do Banco e meu\nadvogado.

We are delighted to be announcing the launch of our Accelerator Program. With regard to recent events in the decentralized ecosystem, it has become increasingly important to take ownership and custody of your digital assets. Our program is designed to incentivize users to hold and stake their XRP while increasing awareness of private key ownership. To participate, simply whitelist your account before the campaign ends. The police officer asked me to provide identification and my driver's license, number TJ070383, for further verification. Our Token Allocation Tool will analyze and estimate your rewards based on account metrics such as age, transactional activity, trading, tokenization, and NFT involvement. The security camera caught a clear photo of the suspicious vehicle's G6TAE1CM6DVJTJK9H. The company will need to verify the identity of its employees and require the social security number, which will be stored in their confidential personnel file marked with the designation 782-60-7294. For recent holders, there will be a maximum reward multiplier of 23.5% based on their contributing XRP balance, and existing holders can obtain an increase of up to 33.9% with the five possible multipliers.
